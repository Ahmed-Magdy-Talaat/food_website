            The unique feature of these meatballs is that people do not season the meat. At present, Inegol Kofte is a signature dish of Bursa. The place where it was first sold is still there. You can visit it and enjoy the original version.

            To create such an impressive look, the cook first coats a baking pan with butter then arranges anchovies all over it. Then he places the prepared pilav on the top. After baking, he turns the pan upside down, resulting in a beautifully shaped Hamsili Pilav dish.

            The modern version of Döner Kebab includes chicken, lamb, or beef and vegetables. In Turkey, it is very popular in Istanbul. This classic dish is worth trying.

            Pancakes With Pistachios
            Katmer is characterized because of its charming green hue from pistachios.
            According to one record, Katmer originated in Turkish in the 14th century during the time the country was under the reign of the Ottoman Empire. However, there is evidence that it first appeared in the 11th century in Gaziantep city.

            Its appearance is very similar to Baklava. Both are made of phyllo dough and topped with clotted cream. However, Katmer has thinner dough and a crispy texture. That’s why people call it “pancake.” Also, it contains grounded pistachios instead of nuts.

            According to Turkish tradition, after the first wedding night, the bride and groom will eat Katmer to wish for a sweet love life.
