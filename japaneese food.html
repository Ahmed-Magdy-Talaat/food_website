            <p>
                If you have never tasted Japanese milk bread (also called Hokkaido milk bread), get ready to meet your new favorite loaf. The world-famous bread is incredibly soft and fluffy with a cloud-like texture, buttery flavor, and enough chew to make it an ideal sandwich bread.

            <p>
                Vegetable tempura is a favorite vegetarian appetizer at Japanese restaurants and a cinch to make at home.

            <p>
                While the literal translation of hiyachi chuka is "chilled Chinese," it is very much a Japanese dish. Popular at restaurants throughout the summer months, it is a cold noodle salad made with chilled ramen noodles, strips of thin egg omelet, sliced luncheon meat, fresh raw vegetables, and other colorful toppings. Enjoy it for a picnic-style lunch at your desk on days when you want to eat lighter.

            <p>
                Pork belly, a well-loved East Asian ingredient, is a boneless and fatty cut of meat from the same region of the pig where bacon comes from. The classic Japanese side dish or appetizer of buta no kakuni calls for slowly braising pork belly in traditional flavorings including soy sauce, rice wine, sake, ginger, and scallions until the meat is meltingly tender.

                Baked chicken karaage is a popular and kid-friendly menu item at izakaya (tapas-style restaurants) in Japan. While it is usually fried, our recipe calls for oven baking the diced and marinated chicken thigh meat for a lighter, less messy dish.

                Short-neck clams, or asari, bring an enormous amount of flavor to this classic Japanese soup. The juice from the cooking clams combines with their steaming water to create the nourishing, clear broth. A little lemon zest and parsley are all that is needed for garnish.
